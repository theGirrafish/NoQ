# NoQ

This repository contains our android application for McHacks 2018. 

With NoQ, skip the line and save your time.
The concept of our app is basically a crowdsourced effort for users to check in at any restaurant/venue when they get there and check out when they leave.
With a certain amount of users, we can approximate how long the line would be in real time and people will be able to judge if they can make it or not.
The main incentive for people to contribute is a points system where discounts correspond to the amount of points you have.


In order to install this app, simply import the project in Android Studio and build it with the android device connected to the computer.
